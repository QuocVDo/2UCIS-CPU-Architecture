This is the manual for running the 2UCIS assembler program intended for WINDOWS 10/11. (If you are
currently running MacOS or a Linux distribution, see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

First, download python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Run through the installation wizard and wait for python to install.

Once installed, hit the windows key and type in "cmd". Open the first program that pops up which should be named
"Command Prompt". Type in "cd <path>" and replace <path> with the path to the assembly.py file. In the same directory
or folder as the assembly.py file should be your assembly file which should hold the instructions for the program.

No libraries are necessary for this program to work.

Once you are in the working directory with both files, you can run the command:

    python assembler.py <assembly.txt> <instructioncode.txt>

where <assembly.txt> is replaced with the name of your file containing the assembly instructions and 
<instructioncode.txt> is replaced with the name of the file you wish to output the machinecode to.
